# BIL-Bank-Loans-Default-Prediction
EXAM PROJECT OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING FOR
FINANCIAL TIME SERIES

Estimating the risk of a loan is an important task within banking. This
makes it interesting to research the possible improvements that can be reached by applying
statistical learning methods to provide a prediction of default status and document the best
performing method(s) by means of a cross-validation exercise. Several scientific papers have
been written about the expected benefits of using machine learning in default prediction
(Abell√°n and Mantas, 2014; Harris, 2015; Huang, Chen, and Wang, 2007). These show that
machine learning can lead to a higher in accuracy default prediction, compared to conventional
methods.

The main purpose is to develop knowledge about the predictive performance of different machine
learning algorithms when used to predict defaults in loans. This is done by implementing
different machine learning algorithms (statistical methods) which can be used to classify
samples. These different algorithms will be used to predict the defaults on loans. The loans
come from two data sets with loans of which it is known whether or not they went into default

Our learning methods used are Logistic Regression, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Decision
tree on test dataset, XGBOOST, cross validation and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models.
